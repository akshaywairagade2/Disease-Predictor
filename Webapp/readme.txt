We have created webapp using streamlit 

All the questions are seen answered first because I was not able to convert the interface in which single single question is asked.

So knowing this start answering from the first question.
The questions will change accordingly to what is your answer. There will be total of 7 questions asked to you .
After answering those questions at last you will see the disease , what is that disease and precautions to be taken.



The idea is completely a decision tree in which the user have to just answer the yes no type queries 7 times.
